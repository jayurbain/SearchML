    "### When to use this workflow\n",
    "This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't predict the subtasks needed. The key difference from simple parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input."

Your EcoFlow is made from premium recycled stainless steel that's built to last literally thousands of refills. That's like saving an entire army of single-use bottles from ending up in our oceans. Pretty cool, right?\n",

      "But here's what'll really make you smile - every EcoFlow bottle helps fund ocean cleanup projects. So while you're sipping your morning coffee or staying hydrated during yoga class, you're actually part of something bigger. Plus, the wide-mouth design means you can easily toss in some ice cubes or give it a proper clean (because nobody likes that funky bottle smell, am I right?).\n",
