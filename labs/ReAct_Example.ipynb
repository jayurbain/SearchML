In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity and was rebranded as PayPal. In 2002, Musk received $176 million after PayPal acquired eBay as the companies largest shareholder, and would much later purchase the X.com domain from PayPal, with the intention of creating an \"everything app\". In 2004, with an investment of $6.3 million, Musk then became the chairman and majority shareholder of Tesla. In 2016, Musk co-founded the neurotechnology startup company Neuralink, with an investment of $100 million, followed by founding the Boring Company to construct tunnels. In 2022, Musk completed his acquisition of Twitter, becoming the CEO of Twitter, prior to its rebranding to X.\n",

In 2023, shareholders filed a lawsuit, and a jury subsequently found Musk and Tesla not liable.
