      "- The plot() method has O(n) complexity due to data retrieval and processing\n",
      "- This is unavoidable given the nature of the task, but should be clearly documented\n",

      "- Consider adding timeout parameters for network requests\n",
      "- The __exit__ method could be more explicit about cleanup operations\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Best Practices:\n",
      "- Consider adding type hints for the return type of plot() method\n",
      "- Consider adding configuration for plot parameters like figure size\n",
      "- Could benefit from caching mechanisms for repeated data requests\n",
